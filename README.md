### Political Accountability

We believe that Michael Brown, Jr. was murdered and that the political structures and representatives in Missouri must be held accountable for their responses, or lack thereof, to his murder.

To this end, we demand the following actions:

1. Resignation of Ferguson Police Chief for release of video purporting to link Michael Brown to a crime, willful spreading of misinformation to the public and press, and inciting protesters.
2. Public apology and financial reparations from Governor Nixon for the actions of the police mobilized at his direction that tear gassed, smoke bombed, and shot protesters.
3. Immediate arrest and charging of Darren Wilson.

-------

### Special Prosecutor for All Deadly Force Cases

We believe that a special prosecutor must be appointed in every incident that involves an officer's use of deadly force.

To this end, we demand the following action:

Establish state law necessitating the appointment of a special prosecutor in any case wherein a police officer used deadly force.

-------

### Police Held Accountable for Use of Deadly Force

We believe that officers should be held accountable for the use of deadly force in every encounter.

To this end, we demand the following actions:

1. Establish state law outlining clear process for the response to any officer-involved situation wherein deadly force is used, including collection of facts, established timeline for release, and public announcements.

2. Establish state law mandating the release of the name of each police officer involved in an incident wherein deadly force was used within 48 hours of theincident.

3. Establish state law requiring an annual report on the use of deadly force by all Missouri Police Departments.

-------

### End Overpolicing and the Criminalization of Poverty

We believe that Missouri has a history and current practice of using fines and fees in structurally and systemically racist ways that disproportionately impact the poor and pushes people further into poverty. This practice must stop immediately and amnesty and fine remittance must be granted for all impacted.

To this end, we demand the following actions:

1. Recall all outstanding warrants on non-violent municipal ordinance violations.

2. Remittance of all fines and fees on outstanding municipal ordinance violations.

3. Missouri State Supreme Court adopt a rule change proportioning fines to income.

4. Establish state law capping revenue from municipal courts at 10%

5. Missouri Attorney General and Missouri Auditor immediately begin to enforce Mack's Creek law stating that municipalities may not exceed more than 30% of revenue from municipal courts.

6. Consolidate municipal courts into 3 regional courts.

7. End "Hot Spot" policing techniques

-------

### Representative Police Force and Intentional Officer Training

We believe that a police force should be representative of those citizens that it is designed to serve and protect. We also believe that police officers should be adequately and intentionally trained to perform essential duties.

To this end, we demand the following actions:

1. Develop statewide recruiting and training program for diverse candidates

2. Require all municipal police  to undergo the full 900 hours of training in order to be a police officer in any Missouri municipality

3. Require all police to meet international certification standards

4. Consolidate police departments

-------

### End Funding for Discriminatory Police Forces

We believe that any police department that engages in racially discriminatory profiling should not receive state or federal funding until corrective actions supported by the United States Department of Justice are successfully implemented.

To this end, we demand the following actions:

1. Develop clear assessment tool, in partnership with the United States Department of Justice, for gauging racial bias in all Missouri police forces that goes beyond the recording of racial composition of police stops.

2. Establish state law that immediately removes local and national funding for any police department that demonstrates racial bias according to the aforementioned assessment tool.

-------

### Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Structural and Systemic Inequalities in Missouri

We believe that an independent commission is necessary to be appointed in consultation with the United States Department of Justice to study and make recommendations related to remedies of civil rights violations in Missouri.

To this end, we demand the following action:

Establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Structural and Systemic Inequalities that includes members from representative organizations, including at least 3 community activists, at least 3 professors from Missouri universities, and at least 5 state or local legislators, to review, through a public hearing process, systemic and structural inequity and to make enforceable recommendations.

-------

### The Right to Protest

We believe in the right to protest and the government's responsibility to honor and protect this right. We believe in the 1st amendment of the United States Constitution.

To this end, we demand the following actions:

1. Nolle prosequi all charges against any protester arrested in relation to the killing of Michael Brown, Jr.

2. Immediately end provocative police behaviors exhibited during protests, including but not limited to the use of police K9s, the use of tear gas and/or smoke bombs, rubber bullets, shouting obscenities at protesters, giving conflicting orders, forcing protesters to continuously walk, and pointing loaded firearms at protesters.


-------

### Pass the National "End Racial Profiling" Legislation

We believe that the United States Congress must pass the "End Racial Profiling" legislation (H. 2851, S. 1038) introduced by Congressman John Conyers.
